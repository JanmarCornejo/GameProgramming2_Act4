ACTIVITY 4

Implementing OOP Systems

3rd person shooter (Preferably Top Down 2D)

control system is up to you

Player has 3 selectable classes with different abilities,

each class  has 1 unique ability

player has health

health returning to zero reloads back into the class selection screen

Enemies:

hitting the enemy player does 1 damage to enemy player

getting hit kills the enemy

Gameplay: Survival



Spawn System:

Enemies:

- Enemies will spawn outside the players viewport and move slowly towards player (no other behavior needed)

Player:

- Player will spawn in center of map but can move around freely

SFX:

- Player Death

- Firing gun/weapon

- Enemy Death

VFX:

weapon projectile hitting enemy

Bonus Points:

Create an object pooling system (google this)

---------------------------------------------------------------

ACTIVITY 5

Achievement System

-  Achievements Popup when a certain condition is met
-  Achievement Progress can be saved

Achievements to Track:
-  Kill 100 Enemies
-  Die without killing a Single Enemy

Hint: use event Action

Save System

-  Must Be able to track Achievements
-  Track Player Location
-  Track Player HP

(no need to track enemy positions)

Object Pooling System
--  Ensure any spawning system that uses instantiate instead uses object pooling to save on system memory (projectiles,guns, enemies) make sure your object pooling system is universal and can accomodate enemies, projectiles, vfx
